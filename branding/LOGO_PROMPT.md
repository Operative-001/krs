Design requirements:
- Clean hexagonal shield shape with internal circuit/node pattern suggesting network defense and rapid response
- Abstract representation of threat prioritization (stacked layers or ranked elements)
- Modern tech aesthetic, suitable for GitHub/security contexts
- Works on both light (#ffffff) and dark (#0d1117) backgrounds
- Recognizable at 32x32 favicon size
- No text in the logo

Color palette:
- Primary: Deep blue (#1a365d) - trust, security
- Accent: Electric cyan (#00d4ff) - speed, tech

Style: Flat, geometric, minimal. Think: Cloudflare, Datadog, Snyk aesthetic.
